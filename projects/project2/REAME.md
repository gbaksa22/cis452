## Baker logic

### Random Recipe Selection
1. **Recipes Array**: Lists all available recipes.
2. **Random Recipe Selection**:
   - `srand(time(NULL) + baker_id)`: Seeds the random number generator uniquely for each baker.
   - `rand() % num_recipes`: Chooses a recipe index in the range `[0, num_recipes - 1]`.
3. **Print Statement**: Outputs which recipe the baker is working on.

### Aquiring Items from Pantry and Fridge
1. **Collect Ingredients**:
   - We create an array of all ingredients the baker needs (`needed_ingredients`).
   - Use `is_acquired` to track which ingredients are already taken.
   
2. **Simultaneous Access**:
   - The loop alternates between checking the pantry and refrigerator.
   - The semaphore (`semop`) ensures that only one baker accesses a resource at a time.

3. **Non-Blocking Resource Use**:
   - If the pantry is busy, the baker can grab ingredients from the refrigerator (or vice versa).

4. **Release Resources**:
   - After accessing a resource, the baker releases the semaphore for others to use.

### Mixing Items with Bowl, Spoon, and Mixer
- The baker must acquire **all three utensils** (bowl, spoon, mixer) **together**, or wait until all are available.
- Once acquired, the baker uses them and releases them afterward.
1. **`utensil_ops`**:
   - Contains semaphore operations for the bowl, spoon, and mixer.
   - These operations are performed together using `semop`.

2. **Acquire Resources**:
   - The semaphore values for all three resources (bowl, spoon, and mixer) are decremented (`-1`) in a single `semop` call. If any resource isnâ€™t available, the baker waits.

3. **Mixing**:
   - Once all three utensils are acquired, the baker "mixes" the ingredients (simulated by a `printf` statement).

4. **Release Resources**:
   - The semaphore values for all three resources are incremented (`+1`) after mixing is complete, making the utensils available for other bakers.
